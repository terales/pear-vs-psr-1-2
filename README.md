## This is a [research code](https://meiert.com/en/blog/20140716/research-and-production/).

# Should I bother about difference between [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php) and 
[PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) + [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) code styles 
or I can safely use latter? 

This repo prepared to find an answer to my own question
["How to set up two different codestyles inside PhpStorm project?"](https://stackoverflow.com/q/44690377/1363799).
